3. **MemoryPressure** and **DiskPressure** are return true if memory is low when running node.

4. **VxLANs** is the underlying technology Flannel uses to allow pods to communicate.

5. An appropriate **CNI(Container Network Interface)** should be chosen to deploy kubernetes using kubeadm.

6. **Ceph** is an object store, not a CNI provider.

7. For network policies to work in Kubernetes, **CNI must enforce** the network policies.If the CNI doesn't support network policies, then applying a YAML formula with a network policy in it will return a success, but the policies will not be enforced.
